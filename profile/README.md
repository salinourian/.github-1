### Hi there, this is n8n 👋

n8n is a low-code automation tool. With over 220 pre-built integrations and a general connector for anything with an API, n8n enables you to connect anything to everything. With n8n you can move beyond simple one step integrations to build multi-step workflows that integrate your tools exactly the way you want, including adding AI functionality. Thanks to its <a href="https://faircode.io/">fair-code</a> distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, have a free community edition, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic, and apps.
